The game is built on the <a href="http://qsp.su">AERO QSP</a> platform and designed for use with FastQSP player by Graylor (bundled with the game). Using other QSP players may lead to incorrect performance of the program.

I want to express special gratitude to <a href="mailto:graylor@yandex.ru">Graylor</a> for creating a non-obstructive player especially for this game.
Thanks to the_vm, to the anon who made awesome grimdark interface, and the rest of the enthusiasts who make the current fixes and continue to develop the game.
Also, big thanks to those who helped out with the creation of the interface decoration, text editing, and beta-testing. I would not be able to do it alone.
