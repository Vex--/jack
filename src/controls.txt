'<div id = "title_scroll_text">    Controls in this game are carried out solely with the help of the mouse. Interactive elements will turn your cursor into a hand, so that you know that they are clickable.
    Almost all actions are available from the central menu, but there are shortcuts for the most common ones. Specifically, orders for cooking, cleaning, cooking, sex, milking, and punishments or rewards can be issued with quick buttons under the charactersâ€™ portraits (when corresponding actions are needed). You can set who will be doing the cleaning and cooking with the rules on your slave/assistant tab. Besides that, the full list of training courses is available if you click on the big button with the image of an academic cap - using it is a lot faster than searching for the required command in the menu.
    Some choices are colored gray. It means that they are unavailable. The reason for this may be not meeting the requirements. Recheck it.

    Have a nice game!
