 $text[3] = 'Also of considerable importance is the mental state of a slave. On one hand, she should not be squeamish or haughty, but on the other, it is good when a girl is temperamental and has strong character.

 $text[1] = 'A rebellious slave - is a complete punishment of its own for a master. One of the most important tasks of any trainer is to obtain unquestioned obedience. This is the only way that you can do further training effectively, and achieve a decent rating.'
 $text[2] = 'The slave’s willingness to obey depends on a variety of factors. It is important to know all of them, and understand how positive factors can be produced and maintained. Listen carefully.'
 $text[3] = 'The first thing that comes to mind: fear. You can then do anything you want with a slave. In most cases it will not be difficult to intimidate her using pain, abuse, and violence. We have been able to determine that the average motivation of fear is almost twice as strong as any other.'
 $text[4] = 'It should be remembered, however, that fear has its pitfalls. Firstly, you have to be careful with punishments, so as to not cause irreparable physical harm to the girl. But even more important, is that you do not damage her mind.'
 $text[5] = 'Whenever you punish a slave, she will not only start to fear you, but her dissatisfaction with you will also grow. This is the quickest way to drive a slave directly into a deep depression. Without any positive motivation, training a slave will be very difficult because her fear and self-pity will stop her from focusing on her training.'
 $text[6] = 'In addition to lowering her mood, fear has an additional dark side. We call it angst or despair. Angst - is a destructive terror emanating from a misunderstanding and rejection of fear. If a slave gets punished without feeling guilt - her angst inevitably grows.'
 $text[7] = 'Sensitive girls may fall into an angsty outlook simply because of her bad mood. When a slave is extremely gentle, fear and angst will lead her to depression faster. Whenever you consider punishing your slave, consider not only the degree of her guilt, but also her sensitivity.'
 $text[8] = 'Angst destroys personality. Under its influence, a slave begins to lose her fire and her self-confidence, gradually breaking her will. In the early stages it can help, but in the end it will only lower her rating. Be careful.'
 $text[9] = 'To get rid of angst, try to ensure that your slave is elated. Satisfied girls will gradually forget their angst. In addition, it will be much easier to learn new material, and she will concentrate more during training.'
 !cоntented - о is a russian letter, to prevent bad thing happening
 $text[10] = 'At the same time, a slave that is cоntented with life will quickly forget about her fear, meaning that you will have to develop other sources of respect to ensure that she obeys you. Namely: habit, taming, awareness, and devotion.'
 $text[11] = 'Let’s start with habit. It is no secret that people can obey orders just because they have become used to doing it. Every time a slave obeys your instructions and rules, her habit of slavery slightly increases. In time, a slave will simply forget that she was once free.'
 $text[12] = 'While boosting the generation of habit is difficult, try to be strict towards your slave, it will speed up the process. A proud personality will develop habit slowly, but habit will gradually make them forget about their pride. On par with their humiliation, of course.'
 $text[13] = 'A good foundation for obedience is a reasonable understanding of a slave’s position. Try to explain to the slave that loyalty will be rewarded, and resistance will lead to inevitable punishment. Mindfulness promotes reasonable obedience, but a strong will can interfere with accepting her fate.'
 $text[14] = 'Reasonable obedience can be achieved not only by direct subordination, but also through reasonable rewards. By rewarding a slave, you do not just improve her mood, you also make her realize that obedient behavior leads to good treatment.'
 $text[15] = 'Be extremely careful though. Rewarding a slave beyond her merits means you not only develop her obedience, but also make her spoiled. A spoiled slave is less controllable, and will always require some kind of positive incentive. Otherwise, she will start to get upset and fall into despair.'
 $text[16] = 'In addition to reasonable obedience, there’s also instinctive obedience, where your slave subconsciously feels your superiority and strives to please you. Less temperamental people are more prone to this type of obedience.'
 $text[17] = 'To develop a slave’s instinctive obedience you can use punishment. When non-compliance causes pain, obedience will become a reflex. Another way to develop it is by using sexual desire. People are subconsciously drawn to the source of their pleasure.'
 $text[18] = 'The final goal of raising her obedience is make her accept slave values, or slave morality. When a slave accepts her position with all her heart and sincerely wants to serve her master, she has reached moral growth. This source of loyalty is doubly valuable because it is the most reliable.'
 $text[19] = 'Slave morality begins to develop when, on the one hand, a slave is satisfied with her position and is in a good mood, and on the other when she has developed habit along with instinct and reasonable obedience. Having a bit of fear is not critical, but it is difficult to build morale with it.'
 $text[20] = 'Acknowledged whip masters are able to sharply raise their slaves’ morale through catharsis: a special state of enlightenment, a moment of truth, coming in the second of highest pain or pleasure. But this technique is available only to the best.'
 $text[21] = 'Summing up, we can isolate some simple rules of training: punish your slave for her misdeeds, but only comparable to her guilt. Reward your slave for good behavior, but only on merit. Give her time to gradually get used to your rules. Control her orgasms and keep watch over her mood.'
 $text[22] = 'I will now say a few words on superiority and physical resistance. It will be much easier to subdue a girl who initially feels that you are stronger, but, on the other hand, if she feels that she is stronger than you, she will not want to obey.'
 $text[23] = 'Whether or not she feels your superiority is influenced by several factors. First - of course - is your physical strength. Second - your spiritual strength and charisma. Third - your experience of command, your ability to dominate. Finally - your appearance. Good looks make it easier to submit to you.'
 $text[24] = 'But a slave’s personal qualities are also important. A strong character, high emotionality and, of course, a slave’s pride will prevent her from feeling your superiority. Also, watch out if she feels smarter than you, and thinks that she can outwit you. She will be less inclined to obey.'
 $text[25] = 'If your superiority is low, she might put up a fight. In response to your attempts to punish or rape her, your slave will defend herself by force. If she can beat you, the consequences can be dire. But your victory will confirm your superiority.'
 $text[26] = 'Superiority itself, even if very high, does not guarantee your orders will be executed, but it will accelerate the development of obedience, and reduce the likelihood of physical confrontation. Keep yourself in good physical shape, develop a commanding voice, and keep a good physical appearance.'

 $text[1] = 'Let’s talk more about punishments and rewards. In the second lecture we talked about angst and spoiling, but I will repeat myself. Punish a slave too much - and we feed angst. Rewarding her with something that she does not deserve - and we pamper and spoil the slave, although it does improve her mood.'
 $text[2] = 'It is important to understand several key point: the merits and sins of a slave differ from case to case. You should understand what made her act in a certain way. Consider two examples to make it more obvious:'
 $text[3] = 'Suppose that you take an innocent girl that is not accustomed to mistreatment, and tell her to mate with a tribal bull for your entertainment. In her eyes, refusing to do that is not a serious offense, as your demand is far above what she is willing to do.'
 $text[4] = 'If you brutally punish the girl for disobeying such an order, it will inevitably lead to angst, as she does not understand why the rejection of such a vile act can be regarded as something impermissible. But over time, things will change.'
 $text[5] = 'If your slave is already trained and rather obedient, she will actually realize her sin. Rejection of that same action with a bull from an already-prepared girl should cause a much more severe reaction from you.'
 $text[6] = 'Same story with rewards. Do not only evaluate the result, but keep the slave’s personality in mind. Suppose your nearly untrained slave has agreed to a lesson on deep-throating. Even if the result is not perfect, she had to agree to it and overcome her resistance. She should be rewarded properly.'
 $text[7] = 'On the contrary, if a slave is doing something very well because she already knows how to do it, but does it completely without effort - she does not deserve a reward. You may even consider punishing her.'
 $text[8] = 'Always evaluate the slave’s merits and sins on a five-point system. And also evaluate the power of your rewards and punishments. Always keep in mind: she gets what she deserves.'
 $text[9] = 'But remember that what I’ve said is for general guidance only. There are cases where it makes sense to punish or reward a slave more than she deserves, even at the risk of angst or spoiling. Decisions are always made by you, using your experience and intuition.'
 $text[10] = 'Now we will be moving on to more specific types and forms of rewards and punishments. Any impact derives its strength from a slave’s specific desires or fears.'
 $text[11] = 'Punishments are based on pain, feelings of helplessness, disgust, shame, psychological vulnerability, and phobias of blood, darkness, spiders, water, fire, or other things.'
 $text[12] = 'Rewards may be based on the need for approval, a desire for comfort, a passion for luxury, sexual pleasure, or even food, if she has a sweet-tooth.'
 $text[13] = 'Each slave has her own strengths and weaknesses, her own passions and phobias. Learn what she wants and what she is afraid of, and then use it for your own purposes - this is the key to gaining control over a slave rapidly.'
 $text[14] = 'Imagine that you have to bring up a fearless, battle-hardened warrior. Surely you will not be able to break her will by flogging her, or by the sight of blood. But you can try to put pressure on her psychologically, or tie her up so that she feels helpless before you.'
 $text[15] = 'Do not forget that a person can get used to everything. Habit is developed to certain types of exposure, and to specific types of punishment or reward. Exceptions only for a slave’s innate phobia or passion. As for the rest, be creative, and try not to repeat them too often.'
 $text[16] = 'Verbal rewards and punishments have one very significant advantage: they do not take a lot of time or effort, neither yours nor your slave’s. However, that is all the upside this method has. Praising and swearing quickly lose their strength, as do threats or promises, if you don’t take action.'
 $text[17] = 'You can punish a slave on the spot without any available tools. It’s quick and practical, but remember that tools increase the efficacy of punishments. In addition, beatings can leave bruises on a girl. Gradually, the wounds will heal, but even traces of them will reduce her rating and charm.'
 $text[18] = 'To inflict pain, try to use the minimum amount of tools at first. For spanking, these are, in ascending order: slippers, belt, cane, lash, or whip. Be careful when using either the lash or the whip, as the scars may remain forever. A lot depends on your skill.'
 $text[19] = 'A great advantage to binding your slave is that it means much less effort. You may punish your slave with an arbitrarily long torment. Nevertheless, bondage, on average, is slightly less effective than a physical punishment of the same level.'
 $text[20] = 'If your slave is aroused - reward her by caressing her. She will not lose any energy herself - moreover, a good massage can even add energy to her. But keep in mind that her arousal goes down if she cums. Otherwise, you will just raise her arousal even more.'
 $text[21] = 'To save your own energy, you can reward your slave with free time. If you just give her a rest, you may be able to use her remaining energy tomorrow. But your slave will be even more joyful if you give her the opportunity to have fun and play games.'
 $text[22] = 'If you have some extra sparks and you are not afraid that your slave may gain weight, you can reward her with sweets. Rare dishes can be very expensive, but even they can become boring if eaten many times in a row. When you reward slave with sweets, try to add variety.'
 $text[23] = 'Some punishments may require special equipment or rooms. For this examination, we will not provide torture tools and units, so you will have to manage with the minimum.'
 $text[24] = 'For some rewards it may be necessary to take the slave into the city. During the examination you must not leave the walls of the guild, so these rewards will not be available. Nevertheless, we are confident that you have enough opportunities for excellence.'

 $text[1] = 'During training you will have to watch out for a number of domestic issues. For this very reason, the majority of slavers acquire a personal assistant, oftentimes one of their slaves. Assistants can help with the housework, entertain you, keep track of your slave or animals, and even teach your slave.'
 $text[2] = 'The Guild does not provide assistants for this exam, so you will have to manage on your own. Of course, you can use the slave for housekeeping too, if she is sufficiently obedient and has the necessary skills.'
 $text[3] = 'It is important to be aware of both your personal hygiene, and your slave’s. Dirt contributes to disease and reduces mood. In addition, a dirty slave will receive greater damage from fights and tortures, as injuries may get infected.'
 $text[4] = 'Dirt accumulates over time and from many activities, especially those related to working, cleaning, cooking, or dirty sex. To maintain hygiene, you should occasionally wash yourself. If you do not have a private bathroom, you will have to go to the salon in the city for yourself, or the onsen for your slave.'
 $text[5] = 'The Guild has bathrooms as standard, so you do not need to go into the city. You can bathe alone, or together with the slave. In the second case, only she will spend her energy, but will wash you both. In addition, this should elevate your mood.'
 $text[6] = 'Your home also gets dirty. Gradually dust and dirt will accumulate, clothes get stale, dishes dirty, and so on. Do not forget to carry out regular cleaning so as to not reduce the mood of all the inhabitants of the house. And remember, the bigger the mess at hand - the more difficult it will be to clean up.'
 $text[7] = 'Homemade food can greatly improve your mood, and your slave’s mood as well. However, its preparation requires time and effort. If you do not want to cook, you can get canned or semi-finished goods.'
 $text[8] = 'Watch the weight of your slave. You should ensure that she is neither too fat nor too starved. Pick portions of food carefully so that the weight of your slave remains stable.'
 $text[9] = 'Another important consideration is your slave’s personal metabolic character. A slave with a good metabolism is capable of absorbing nearly twice as many calories as normal without harm, and will restore health through diet. A girl with a weak metabolism will quickly gain excess weight, and it will be difficult for her to lose weight.'
 $text[10] = 'If you are not a born cook or butler, doing housework is a heavy burden on your mood. However, until you have an assistant, you should do it yourself, as giving this task to a slave may not be appropriate, especially if she does not have enough energy.'
