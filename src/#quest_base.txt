$quest_description[2] = 'NB! First I need to make sure that she is branded. And I can’t forget about a stylish appearance for my slave - a fine dress helps to impress.
   Selling options:
I. The auction of brands in the Guild. The auction is held every decade, but the price there may be most unexpected.
II. Hand her over to one of the regular customers. Easily and reliably, but not optimal.
III. Find the end user and make a deal personally. A fixed price, plus the growing popularity of the brand, plus reputation in one of the Great Houses. To find the optimal end buyer I need to collect information at the Central Forum. I should look for those who desire her specialty and rank to maximize profits! I should remember that the customer information will be relevant to the current development of slave and will gradually lose relevance. I better start looking for buyers when she is ready for sale.

$quest_description[3] = 'In Rome, there are five persons who are able to give me the status of patrician and lead me to the category of honorary citizen:
   Pope Ioann can give me the status of patrician of White Town. To reach it, I must have a very famous brand and enlist the support of one of the Cardinals.
   The King of Taurus House can initiate me into knighthood. I need to remember that the Bulls do not like beastmen. A close relationship with the Camira House shuts this way for me.
   The President of Serpis House can make me an honorary citizen if I earn the trust of the Serpents. The main thing is not to be too close to the undead of the Corvus House.
   If the Mistress of Camira House accepts me into her pack of "dragons" I will be a big shot among nonhumans. I just need to remember their feud with Taurus House.
   Finally, I can turn to the Prince of Corvus House. A title of nobility from the undead is a very important acquisition, but then I should not get too close to Serpis House.

$quest_description[6] = '  Sir Aramus, military quartermaster from the Taurus House, offers me a magic ring in exchange for a slave - a champion of the arena. According to him this ring is able to double the endurance of a person in combat, and give the wearer an aura of strength and power.
If needed, I will be able to find Aramus at the Central forum.

$quest_description[7] = '  Vujin, a creator of artifacts from the Serpis House offers a magical amulet in exchange for a slave who won races in the Colosseum. According to him this amulet is able to give the wearer an aura of confidence and personal strength, as well as double the ability to tolerate pain and fear, tempering spirit during battles.
Vujin likes to walk at the Central forum, I may find him there if necessary.

$quest_description[8] = '  A strange hissing creature named Garsid walks through the Central forum with naked pregnant slaves and pesters people with vile suggestions. He promised me a magical artifact that enhances potency and sexual desire, as well as attractiveness and blood clotting. He wants to swap it for a perfectly prepared, from a sexual perspective, slave. Moreover, other parameters are irrelevant.
Probably worth trying. Raising such a slave should not be too difficult. But this will take some time.

$quest_description[9] = '  Master Valios, a necromancer studying fiends of the Fog, promised me a magical artifact in exchange for a full-grown and living fiend. Growing such a creature is not easy, but when its life cycle is about to end it becomes useless anyway. And this «raven crown» thing is tempting. The necromancer says that it gives a permanent auspex ability and also creates an aura of power.
When I have a living seasoned fiend, grown to leviathan form, it is necessary to look for him at the Central forum.

$quest_description[10] = '  I received a contract in the guild to train a slave as a <font color="#0000CD"><<$slave_type_name[$specialisation[specialisation]]>></font>, she must be at least <<$rating[contract_level[brand_reputation]]>> <font color="#0000CD"> rank</font> or higher.

<u>Reminder, do not forget!</u>

To prepare a slave for a specific specialization, I need to train her profile skill to at least <font color="#0000CD">average</font> level. Concubines also require a sum of over nine sex techniques. If I have an assistant, she will tell me when a slave corresponds to which specialization.

Usual time limit on the contract:
When ordering <<$rating[1]>>-rank: 25 days, 
When ordering <<$rating[2]>>-rank: 50 days,
When ordering <<$rating[3]>>-rank: 120 days,
When ordering <<$rating[4]>>-rank: 250 days,
When ordering <<$rating[5]>>-rank: 500 days.
